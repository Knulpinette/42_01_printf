This project is pretty straight forward. You will recode printf. You will mainly learn how to use variadic arguments and set up well-structured and extensible code.

 **You can check the comments in the code for more details.**

> #### Note <br>
> Recoded printf for both Mac and Linux as Moulinette was evaluating the Mac version while I was working on Linux. I discovered later you could just do a Makefile that would handle both cases at once with the subtle use of macros 😭
